*Filter > Duplicate Nodes* (*en:* Duplicate Nodes, *de:* Punkte verdoppeln, *fr:* Dupliquer n≈ìuds, *es:* Duplicar nodos, *pt:* Duplicar nodos, *it:* Duplica nodi) is a Glyphs.app filter for duplicating selected on-curve nodes in place.

## Usage

Select one or more on-curve nodes in Edit view and run the filter. 

Hold down **Opt** to duplicate the same nodes in all (compatible) masters. 

Hold down **Shift** to add the new nodes not exactly on top, but with 1u distance. Careful: will change the following segment slightly, i.e., give it a small inclination.
 
## Installation

*Duplicate Nodes* is [available in the Glyphs&nbsp;3 Plugin Manager](glyphsapp3://showplugin/Duplicate%20Nodes). Click on the *Install* button next to it and restart Glyphs.
